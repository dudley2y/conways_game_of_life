# conways_game_of_life

Conway's game of life was invented in 1970's by John Conways.
This is an example of how cellular automaton evolve over time.
The game is trying to mimic human population given a certain set of rules.

##Rules:
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

##About
In order to run the program, copy the files from github and open a terminal.
Use the ```make``` command to run open the file.

The program will ask you to input dimensions and the amount of cells you want filled.
One filled out, the game will run and you can observe from there.
